After identifying the services running on the port(using Nmap) the first thing to do is look if any of the applications/services have any public exploits.
Public exploits can be found i web apps and other apps running on the port like ssh(22) or ftp(20/21).

# Metasploit Primer
The Metasploit Framework(MSF) is an excellent tool for pentester.
MSF has many other features, like:

- Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets([[mo1]]).
    
- Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerability without actually compromising the target
    
- Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and run commands on the compromised targets
    
- Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools
