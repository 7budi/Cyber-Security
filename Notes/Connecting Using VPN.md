A [virtual private network (VPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) allows us to connect to a private (internal) network and access hosts and resources as if we were directly connected to the target private network.
It is a secured communications channel over shared public networks to connect to a private network (i.e., an employee remotely connecting to their company's corporate network from their home).
