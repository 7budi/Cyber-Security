A service is an application running on a computer that performs some useful function for other users or computers. We call these specialized machines that host these useful services "servers" instead of workstations, allowing users to interact with and consume these various services. What we're interested in are services that have either been misconfigured or have a vulnerability. Instead of performing the actions expected as part of the service, we are interested to see if we can coerce the service into performing some unintended action that supports our objectives, such as executing a command of our choosing.
